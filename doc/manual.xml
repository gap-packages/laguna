<Abstract>

<Index Key="LAGUNA package">&LAGUNA; package</Index> 
The title ``&LAGUNA;'' stands for ``<B>L</B>ie <B>A</B>l<B>G</B>ebras and 
<B>UN</B>its of group <B>A</B>lgebras''.
This is the new name of the &GAP;4 package &LAG;, which is thus replaced by &LAGUNA;.
<P/>
&LAGUNA; extends the &GAP; functionality for computations in group rings. Besides 
computing some general properties and attributes of group rings and their 
elements, &LAGUNA; is able to perform two main kinds of computations. Namely, 
it can verify  whether a group algebra of a finite group satisfies certain 
Lie properties; and it can calculate the structure of the normalized unit group
of a group algebra of a finite <M>p</M>-group over
the field of <M>p</M> elements.

<Acknowledgements>

Some of the features of &LAGUNA; were already included in the &GAP;4 package
&LAG; written by the third author, Richard Rossmanith. 
<!--which was ported to &GAP;4 during his visit to
St Andrews in September 1998. Since in the new version the functionality
of the package is no longer restricted to Lie algebras, the package
changed its name to &LAGUNA; which means "Lie AlGebras and UNits of group
Algebras".-->
The three other authors first would like to thank Greg Gamble for
maintaining &LAG; and for upgrading it from version 2.0
to version 2.1, and Richard Rossmanith for allowing them to update
and extend the &LAG; package. We are also grateful to Wolfgang Kimmerle
for organizing the workshop ``Computational Group and Group Ring
Theory'' (University of Stuttgart, 28--29 November, 2002), which allowed
us to meet and have fruitful discussions that led towards the final
&LAGUNA; release.
<P/> 
We  are all very grateful to the members of the &GAP; team: Thomas Breuer,
Willem de Graaf, Alexander Hulpke, Stefan Kohl, Steve Linton, Frank L&#252;beck, 
Max Neunh&#246;ffer and many other colleagues for helpful comments and advise.
We acknowledge very much Herbert Pahlings for communicating the package 
and the referee for careful testing &LAGUNA; and useful suggestions.       
<P/> 
A part of the work on upgrading &LAG; to &LAGUNA; was done in 2002 during
Olexandr Konovalov's visits to Debrecen, St Andrews and Stuttgart 
Universities.
He would like to express his gratitude to Adalbert Bovdi and
Victor Bovdi, Colin Campbell, Edmund Robertson and Steve Linton,
Wolfgang Kimmerle, Martin Hertweck and Stefan Kohl for their warm
hospitality, and to the NATO Science Fellowship Program, to the London
Mathematical Society and to the DAAD for the support of these visits.
