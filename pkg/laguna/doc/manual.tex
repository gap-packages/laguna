\logpage{[ 0, 0, 1 ]}
 \index{LAGUNA package@\textsf{LAGUNA} package} The title ``\textsf{LAGUNA}'' stands for ``\textsc{L}ie \textsc{A}l\textsc{G}ebras and \textsc{UN}its of group \textsc{A}lgebras''. This is the new name of the \textsf{GAP}4 package \textsf{LAG}, which is thus replaced by \textsf{LAGUNA}. 

 \textsf{LAGUNA} extends the \textsf{GAP} functionality for computations in group rings. Besides computing some general
properties and attributes of group rings and their elements, \textsf{LAGUNA} is able to perform two main kinds of computations. Namely, it can verify
whether a group algebra of a finite group satisfies certain Lie properties;
and it can calculate the structure of the normalized unit group of a group
algebra of a finite $p$-group over the field of $p$ elements.

 Some of the features of \textsf{LAGUNA} were already included in the \textsf{GAP}4 package \textsf{LAG} written by the third author, Richard Rossmanith.  The three other authors first would like to thank Greg Gamble for maintaining \textsf{LAG} and for upgrading it from version 2.0 to version 2.1, and Richard Rossmanith
for allowing them to update and extend the \textsf{LAG} package. We are also grateful to Wolfgang Kimmerle for organizing the workshop
``Computational Group and Group Ring Theory'' (University of Stuttgart, 28--29
November, 2002), which allowed us to meet and have fruitful discussions that
led towards the final \textsf{LAGUNA} release. 

 We are all very grateful to the members of the \textsf{GAP} team: Thomas Breuer, Willem de Graaf, Alexander Hulpke, Stefan Kohl, Steve
Linton, Frank L{\"u}beck, Max Neunh{\"o}ffer and many other colleagues for
helpful comments and advise. We acknowledge very much Herbert Pahlings for
communicating the package and the referee for careful testing \textsf{LAGUNA} and useful suggestions. 

 A part of the work on upgrading \textsf{LAG} to \textsf{LAGUNA} was done in 2002 during Alexander Konovalov's visits to Debrecen, St Andrews
and Stuttgart Universities. He would like to express his gratitude to Adalbert
Bovdi and Victor Bovdi, Colin Campbell, Edmund Robertson and Steve Linton,
Wolfgang Kimmerle, Martin Hertweck and Stefan Kohl for their warm hospitality,
and to the NATO Science Fellowship Program, to the London Mathematical Society
and to the DAAD for the support of these visits.

{
  \textsf{LAGUNA} -- \textsc{L}ie \textsc{A}l\textsc{G}ebras and \textsc{UN}its of group \textsc{A}lgebras -- is the new name of the \textsf{GAP}4 package \textsf{LAG}. The \textsf{LAG} package arose as a byproduct of the third author's PhD thesis  \cite{Ros97}. Its first version was ported to \textsf{GAP}4 and was brought into the standard \textsf{GAP}4 package format during his visit to St Andrews in September 1998. 

 The main objective of \textsf{LAG} is to deal with Lie algebras associated with some associative algebras, and,
in particular, Lie algebras of group algebras. Using \textsf{LAG} it is possible to verify some properties or calculate certain Lie ideals of
such Lie algebras very efficiently, due to their special structure. In the
current version of \textsf{LAGUNA} the main part of the Lie algebra functionality is heavily built on the
previous \textsf{LAG} releases. 

 The \textsf{GAP}4 package \textsf{LAGUNA} also extends the \textsf{GAP} functionality for calculations with units of modular group algebras. In
particular, using this package, one can check whether an element of such a
group algebra is invertible. \textsf{LAGUNA} also contains an implementation of an efficient algorithm to calculate the
(normalized) unit group of the group algebra of a finite $p$-group over the field of $p$ elements. \index{SISYPHOS package@\textsf{SISYPHOS} package} Thus, the present version of \textsf{LAGUNA} provides a part of the functionality of the \textsf{SISYPHOS} program, which was developed by Martin Wursthorn to study the modular
isomorphism problem; see \cite{Wursthorn}. 

 The corresponding functions of \textsf{LAGUNA} use the same algorithmic and theoretical approach as those in \textsf{SISYPHOS}. The reason why we reimplemented the normalised unit group algorithms in the \textsf{LAGUNA} package is that \textsf{SISYPHOS} has no interface to \textsf{GAP}4, and, even in \textsf{GAP}3, it is cumbersome to use the \textsf{SISYPHOS} output for further computation with the normalised unit group. For instance,
using \textsf{SISYPHOS} with its \textsf{GAP}3 interface, it is difficult to embed a finite $p$-group into the normalized unit group of its group algebra over the field of $p$ elements, but this can easily be done with \textsf{LAGUNA}. }

\hyperdef{L}{X790BFE667E3BEC3A}{}
{
  The \textsf{LAGUNA} package provides a set of functions to carry out some basic computations with
a group ring and its elements. Among other things, \textsf{LAGUNA} provides elementary functions to compute such basic notions as support,
length, trace and augmentation of an element. For modular group algebras of
finite $p$-groups \textsf{LAGUNA} is able to calculate the power-structure of the augmentation ideal, which is
useful for the construction of the normalised unit group; see Sections \ref{GenSec}--\ref{Ideals} for more details. }

  
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Computations in the normalized unit group}}\label{IntroSecond}
\logpage{[ 1, 3, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7B7E5E987DBBA237}{}
{
  One of the aims of the \textsf{LAGUNA} package is to carry out efficient computations in the normalised unit group of
the group algebra $FG$ of a finite $p$-group $G$ over the field $F$ of $p$ elements. If $U$ is the unit group of $FG$ then it is easy to see that $U$ is the direct product of $F^*$ and $V(FG)$, where $F^*$ is the multiplicative group of $F$, and $V(FG)$ is the group of normalised units. A unit of $FG$ of the form $\alpha_1 \cdot g_1 + \alpha_2 \cdot g_2 + \cdots + \alpha_k \cdot g_k$ with $\alpha_i \in F$ and $g_i \in G$ is said to be normalised if the sum $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \cdots + \alpha_k$ is equal to $1$. 

 It is well-known that the normalised unit group $V$ has order $|F|^{|G|-1}$, and so $V$ is a finite $p$-group. Thus computing $V$ efficiently means to compute a polycyclic presentation for $V$. For the theory of polycyclic presentations refer to \cite[Chapter 9]{Sims}. For this computation we use an algorithm that was also used in the \textsf{SISYPHOS} package. For a brief description see Chapter \ref{Theory}. The functions that compute the structure of the normalised unit group are
described in Section \ref{UnitGroup}. }

  
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Computing Lie properties of the group algebra }}\label{IntroThird}
\logpage{[ 1, 4, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X78B33FFF7A5D2FEF}{}
{
  The functions that are used to compute Lie properties of $p$-modular group algebras were already included in the previous versions of \textsf{LAG}. The bracket operation $[\cdot,\cdot]$ on a $p$-modular group algebra $FG$ is defined by $[a,b]=ab-ba$. It is well-known and very easy to check that $(FG, +, [\cdot,\cdot])$ is a Lie algebra. Then we may ask what kind of Lie algebra properties are
satisfied by $FG$. The results in \cite{LR86}, \cite{PPS73}, and \cite{Ros00} give fast, practical algorithms to check whether the Lie algebra $FG$ is abelian, nilpotent, soluble, centre-by-metabelian, etc. The functions that
implement these algorithms are described in Section \ref{LieAlgebra}. }

{
  \textsf{LAGUNA} does not use external binaries and, therefore, works without restrictions on
the type of the operating system. It is designed for \textsf{GAP}4.4 and no compatibility with previous releases of \textsf{GAP}4 is guaranteed. 

 To use the \textsf{LAGUNA} online help it is necessary to install the \textsf{GAP}4 package \textsf{GAPDoc} by Frank L{\"u}beck and Max Neunh{\"o}ffer, which is available from the \textsf{GAP} site or from \href{http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/} {\texttt{http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/\texttt{\symbol{126}}Frank.Luebeck/GAPDoc/}}. 

 \textsf{LAGUNA} is distributed in standard formats (\texttt{zoo}, \texttt{tar.gz}, \texttt{tar.bz2}, \texttt{-win.zip}) and can be obtained from \href{http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~alexk/laguna/} {\texttt{http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/\texttt{\symbol{126}}alexk/laguna/}}. To unpack the archive \texttt{laguna-X.X.X.zoo} you need the program \texttt{unzoo}, which can be obtained from the \textsf{GAP} homepage \href{http://www.gap-system.org/} {\texttt{http://www.gap-system.org/}} (see section `Distribution'). To install \textsf{LAGUNA}, copy this archive into the \texttt{pkg} subdirectory of your \textsf{GAP}4.4 installation. The subdirectory \texttt{laguna} will be created in the \texttt{pkg} directory after the following command: 

 \texttt{unzoo -x laguna-X.X.X.zoo}

\chapter{\textcolor{Chapter }{A sample calculation with \textsf{LAGUNA}}}\label{Example}
\logpage{[ 2, 0, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7E9EADCA7F1D9DC8}{}
{
  Before explaining the theory behind the \textsf{LAGUNA} package we present a sample calculation to show the reader what \textsf{LAGUNA} is able to compute. We will carry out some calculations in the group algebra
of the dihedral group of order 16 over the field of two elements. First we
create this modular group algebra. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@K := GF( 2 );|
  GF(2)
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@G := DihedralGroup( 16 );|
  <pc group of size 16 with 4 generators>
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@KG := GroupRing( K, G );|
  <algebra-with-one over GF(2), with 4 generators>
  
\end{Verbatim}
 The group algebra \texttt{KG} has some properties and attributes that are direct consequences of its
definition. These can be checked very quickly. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@IsGroupAlgebra( KG ); |
  true
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@IsPModularGroupAlgebra( KG );|
  true
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@IsFModularGroupAlgebra( KG );|
  true
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@UnderlyingGroup( KG );|
  <pc group of size 16 with 4 generators>
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@LeftActingDomain( KG );|
  GF(2)
  
\end{Verbatim}
 Since \texttt{KG} is naturally a group algebra, the information provided by \texttt{LeftActingDomain} can also be obtained using two other functions as follows. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@UnderlyingRing( KG );|
  GF(2)
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@UnderlyingField( KG );|
  GF(2)
\end{Verbatim}
 Let us construct a certain element of the group algebra. For example, we take
a minimal generating system of the group \texttt{G} and find the corresponding elements in \texttt{KG}. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@MinimalGeneratingSet( G );|
  [ f1, f2 ]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@l := List( last, g -> g^Embedding( G, KG ) );|
  [ (Z(2)^0)*f1, (Z(2)^0)*f2 ]
  
\end{Verbatim}
 Now we construct an element \texttt{x} as follows. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@a :=l[1]; b:=l[2]; # a and b are images of group generators in KG|
  (Z(2)^0)*f1
  (Z(2)^0)*f2
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@e := One( KG );    # for convenience, we denote the identity by e|
  (Z(2)^0)*<identity> of ...
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@x := ( e + a ) * ( e + b ); |
  (Z(2)^0)*<identity> of ...+(Z(2)^0)*f1+(Z(2)^0)*f2+(Z(2)^0)*f1*f2  
  
\end{Verbatim}
 We may investigate some of the basic properties of our element. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@Support( x );|
  [ <identity> of ..., f1, f2, f1*f2 ]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@CoefficientsBySupport( x );|
  [ Z(2)^0, Z(2)^0, Z(2)^0, Z(2)^0 ]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@Length( x );|
  4
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@TraceOfMagmaRingElement( x );|
  Z(2)^0
  
\end{Verbatim}
 We can also calculate the augmentation of \texttt{x}, which is defined as the sum of its coefficients. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@Augmentation( x );|
  0*Z(2)
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@IsUnit( KG, x );|
  false
\end{Verbatim}
 Since the augmentation of \texttt{x} is zero, \texttt{x} is not invertible, but \texttt{1+x} is. This is again very easy to check. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@y := e + x;|
  (Z(2)^0)*f1+(Z(2)^0)*f2+(Z(2)^0)*f1*f2
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@IsUnit( KG, y );|
  true  
  
\end{Verbatim}
 \textsf{LAGUNA} can calculate the inverse of \texttt{1+x} very quickly. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@y^-1;|
  (Z(2)^0)*f1+(Z(2)^0)*f2+(Z(2)^0)*f3+(Z(2)^0)*f4+(Z(2)^0)*f1*f2+(Z(2)^
  0)*f1*f3+(Z(2)^0)*f1*f4+(Z(2)^0)*f2*f4+(Z(2)^0)*f1*f2*f4+(Z(2)^0)*f2*f3*f4+(
  Z(2)^0)*f1*f2*f3*f4
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@y * y^-1;|
  (Z(2)^0)*<identity> of ... 
  
\end{Verbatim}
 We may also want to check whether \texttt{y} is symmetric, that is, whether it is invariant under the classical involution;
or whether it is unitary, that is, whether the classical involution inverts \texttt{y}. We find that \texttt{y} is neither. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@Involution( y );|
  (Z(2)^0)*f1+(Z(2)^0)*f1*f2+(Z(2)^0)*f2*f3*f4
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@y = Involution( y );|
  false
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@IsSymmetric( y );|
  false
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@y * Involution( y );|
  (Z(2)^0)*<identity> of ...+(Z(2)^0)*f2+(Z(2)^0)*f2*f3*f4  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@IsUnitary( y );|
  false
  
\end{Verbatim}
 Now we calculate some important ideals of \texttt{KG}. First we obtain the augmentation ideal which is the set of elements with
augmentation zero. In our case the augmentation ideal of \texttt{KG} coincides with the radical of \texttt{KG}, and this is taken into account in \textsf{LAGUNA}. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@AugmentationIdeal( KG );|
  <two-sided ideal in <algebra-with-one over GF(2), with 4 generators>,
    (dimension 15)>
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@RadicalOfAlgebra( KG ) = AugmentationIdeal( KG );|
  true
  
\end{Verbatim}
 It is well-known that the augmentation ideal of \texttt{KG} is a nilpotent ideal. Using Jennings' theory on dimension subgroups, we can
obtain its nilpotency index without immediate calculation of its powers. This
is implemented in \textsf{LAGUNA}. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@AugmentationIdealNilpotencyIndex( KG );|
  9
\end{Verbatim}
 \newpage On the other hand, we can also calculate the powers of the augmentation ideal. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@AugmentationIdealPowerSeries( KG );|
  [ <algebra of dimension 15 over GF(2)>, <algebra of dimension 13 over GF(2)>, 
    <algebra of dimension 11 over GF(2)>, <algebra of dimension 9 over GF(2)>, 
    <algebra of dimension 7 over GF(2)>, <algebra of dimension 5 over GF(2)>, 
    <algebra of dimension 3 over GF(2)>, <algebra of dimension 1 over GF(2)>, 
    <algebra over GF(2)> ]
  
\end{Verbatim}
 We see that the length of this list is exactly the nilpotency index of the
augmentation ideal of \texttt{KG}. 

 Now let's work with the unit group of \texttt{KG}. First we calculate the normalized unit group, which is the set of elements
with augmentation one. The generators of the unit group are obtained as
explained in Chapter \ref{Theory}. This can be computed very quickly, but further computation with this group
is very inefficient. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@V := NormalizedUnitGroup( KG );|
  <group of size 32768 with 15 generators>   
  
\end{Verbatim}
 In order to make our computation in the normalised unit group efficient, we
calculate a power-commutator presentation for this group. 
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=!@|,fontsize=\small,frame=single,label=Example]
  
  !gapprompt@gap>| !gapinput@W := PcNormalizedUnitGroup( KG );|
  <pc group of size 32768 with 15 generators>
  
\end{Verbatim}
 \textsf{GAP} has many efficient and practical algorithms for groups given by a
power-commutator presentation. In order to use these algorithms to carry out
computation in the normalised unit group, we need to set up isomorphisms
between the outputs of \texttt{NormalizedUnitGroup} and \texttt{PcNormalizedUnitGroup}. 

 The first isomorphism maps \texttt{NormalizedUnitGroup(KG)} onto the polycyclically presented \texttt{PcNormalizedUnitGroup(PC)}. Let's find the images of the elements of the group \texttt{G} in \texttt{W}.

use the full power of the \textsf{GAP} functionality for such groups. For example, the lower central series can be
calculated very quickly.

\logpage{[ 3, 1, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X85C2DE1486FB45FD}{}
{
  \index{group algebra} Let $G$ be a group and $F$ a field. Then the \emph{group algebra} $FG$ consists of the set of formal linear combinations of the form 
\[ \sum_{g \in G}\alpha_g g,\qquad \alpha_g \in F \]
 where all but finitely many of the $\alpha_g$ are zero. The group algebra $FG$ is an $F$-algebra with the obvious operations. Clearly, $\dim FG=|G|$.

 \index{augmentation homomorphism} \index{augmentation ideal} The \emph{augmentation homomorphism} $ \chi : FG \rightarrow F$ is defined by 
\[ \chi\left(\sum_{g \in G}\alpha_g g\right)=\sum_{g \in G}\alpha_g. \]
 It is easy to see that $\chi$ is indeed a homomorphism onto $F$. The kernel of $\chi$ is called the \emph{augmentation ideal} of $FG$. The augmentation ideal is denoted $A(FG)$, or simply $A$ when there is no danger of confusion. It follows from the isomorphism theorems
that $\dim A(FG)=\dim FG-1=|G|-1$. Another way to write the augmentation ideal is 
\[ A(FG)=\left\{\sum_{g \in G}\alpha_g g\ |\ \sum_{g \in G}\alpha_g=0\right\}. \]


 \index{unit} \index{unit group} \index{normalised unit} \index{normalised unit group} An invertible element of $FG$ is said to be a \emph{unit}. Clearly the elements of $G$ and the non-zero elements of $F$ are units. The set of units in $FG$ is a group with respect to the multiplication of $FG$. The \emph{unit group} of $FG$ is denoted $U(FG)$ or simply $U$ when there is no risk of confusion. A unit $u$ is said to be \emph{normalised} if $\chi(u)=1$. The set of normalised units forms a subgroup of the unit group, and is
referred to as the \emph{normalised unit group}. The normalised unit group of $FG$ is denoted $V(FG)$, or simply $V$. It is easy to prove that $U(FG) = F^* \times V(FG)$ where $F^*$ denotes the multiplicative group of $F$. }

  
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{$p$-modular group algebras}}\label{TheorySecond}
\logpage{[ 3, 2, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X80A5F4BD78768C75}{}
{
  \index{p-modular group algebra@$p$-modular group algebra} A group algebra $FG$ is said to be $p$-modular if $F$ is the field of characteristic $p$, and $G$ is a finite $p$-group. A lot of information about the structure of $p$-modular group algebras can be found in \cite[Chapter VIII]{HB}. In a $p$-modular group algebra we have that an element $u$ is a unit if and only if $\chi(u)\neq 0$. Hence the normalised unit group $V$ consists of all elements of $FG$ with augmentation $1$. In other words $V$ is a coset of the augmentation ideal, namely $V=1+A$. This also implies that $|V|=|A|=|F|^{|G|-1}$, and so $V$ is a finite $p$-group. 

 \index{power-commutator presentation} One of the aims of the \textsf{LAGUNA} package is to compute a power-commutator presentation for the normalised unit
group in the case when $G$ is a finite $p$-group and $F$ is a field of $p$ elements. Such a presentation is given by generators $y_1, \ldots, y_{|G|-1} $ and two types of relations: $y_i^p=(y_{i+1})^{\alpha_{i,i+1}} \cdots (y_{|G|-1})^{\alpha_{i,|G|-1}}$ for $ 1 \leq i \leq |G|-1 $, and $ [y_j,y_i]=(y_{j+1})^{\alpha_{j,i,j+1}} \cdots (y_{|G|-1})^{\alpha_{j,i,|G|-1}} $ for $ 1 \leq i < j \leq |G|-1$, where the exponents $\alpha_{i,k}$ and $\alpha_{i,j,k}$ are elements of the set $\{0,\ldots,p-1\}$. Having such a presentation, it is possible to carry out efficient
computations in the finite $p$-group $V$; see \cite[Chapter 9]{Sims}. }

  
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Polycyclic generating set for $V$}}\label{TheoryThird}
\logpage{[ 3, 3, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7FB81FE082DFF909}{}
{
  Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group and $F$ the field of $p$ elements. Our aim is to construct a power-commutator presentation for $V=V(FG)$. We noted earlier that $V=1+A$, where $A$ is the augmentation ideal. We use this piece of information and construct a
polycyclic generating set for $V$ using a suitable basis for $A$. Before constructing this generating set, we note that $A$ is a nilpotent ideal in $FG$. In other words there is some $c$ such that $A^c\neq 0$ but $A^{c+1}=0$. Hence we can consider the following series of ideals in $A$: 
\[ A\rhd A^2\rhd\cdots\rhd A^{c}\rhd A^{c+1}=0. \]
 It is clear that a quotient $A^i/A^{i+1}$of this chain has trivial multiplication, that is, such a quotient is a
nil-ring. The chain $A^i$ gives rise to a series of normal subgroups in $V$: 
\[ V=1+A\rhd 1+A^2\rhd\cdots\rhd 1+A^c\rhd 1+A^{c+1}=1. \]
 It is easy to see that the chain $1+A^i$ is central, that is, $(1+A^i)/(1+A^{i+1})\leq Z((1+A)/(1+A^{i+1}))$. 

 \index{Jennings series} \index{dimension basis} \index{weight, of dimension basis element} Now we show how to compute a basis for $A^i$ that gives a polycyclic generating set for $1+A^i$. Let 
\[ G=G_1 \rhd G_2\rhd\cdots\rhd G_{k}\rhd G_{k+1}=1 \]
 be the \emph{Jennings series} of $G$. That is, $G_{i+1}=[G_i,G]G_{j^p}$ where $j$ is the smallest non-negative integer such that $j\geq i/p$. For all $i\leq k$ select elements $x_{i,1},\ldots,x_{i,l_i}$ of $G_i$ such that $\{x_{i,1}G_{i+1},\ldots,x_{i,l_i}G_{i+1}\}$ is a minimal generating set for the elementary abelian group $G_i/G_{i+1}$. For the Jennings series it may happen that $G_i=G_{i+1}$ for some $i$. In this case we choose an empty generating set for the quotient $G_i/G_{i+1}$ and $l_i=0$. Then the set $x_{1,1},\ldots,x_{1,l_1},\ldots,x_{k,1},\ldots,x_{k,l_k}$ is said to be a \emph{dimension basis} for $G$. The \emph{weight} of a dimension basis element $x_{i,j}$ is $i$.

 \index{standard product} A non-empty product 
\[ u=(x_{1,1}-1)^{\alpha_{1,1}}\cdots(x_{1,l_1}-1)^{\alpha_{1,l_1}}\cdots
(x_{k,1}-1)^{\alpha_{k,1}}\cdots(x_{k,l_k}-1)^{\alpha_{k,l_k}} \]
 where $0\leq \alpha_{i,j}\leq p-1$ is said to be \emph{standard}. Clearly, a standard product is an element of the augmentation ideal $A$. The weight of the standard product $u$ is 
\[ \sum_{i=1}^k i(\alpha_{i,1}+\cdots+\alpha_{i,l_i}). \]
 The total number of standard products is $|G|-1$ . 

 \textsc{Lemma (}\cite[Theorem VIII.2.6]{HB}\textsc{).} For $i\leq c$, the set $S_i$ of standard products of weight at least $i$ forms a basis for $A^i$. Moreover, the set $1+S_i=\{1+s\ |\ s \in S_i\}$ is a polycyclic generating set for $1+A^i$. In particular $1+S_1$ is a polycyclic generating set for $V$. 

 A basis for $A$ consisting of the standard products is referred to as a \emph{weighted basis}. Note that a weighted basis is a basis for the augmentation ideal, and not
for the whole group algebra.

 Let $x_1,\ldots,x_{{|G|}-1}$ denote the standard products where we choose the indices so that the weight of $x_i$ is not larger than the weight of $x_{i+1}$ for all $i$, and set $y_i=1+x_i$. Then every element $v$ of $V$ can be uniquely written in the form 
\[ v=y_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots (y_{|G|-1})^{\alpha_{|G|-1}}, \quad
\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{|G|-1} \in \{0,\ldots,p-1\}. \]
 This expression is called the \emph{canonical form} of $v$. We note that by adding a generator of $F^*$ to the set $y_1,\ldots,y_{|G|-1|}$ we can obtain a polycyclic generating set for the unit group $U$. }

  
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Computing the canonical form}}\label{TheoryFourth}
\logpage{[ 3, 4, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7DCB12F48752C17E}{}
{
  We show how to compute the canonical form of a normalised unit with respect to
the polycyclic generating set $y_1,\ldots,y_{|G|-1}$. We use the following elementary lemma. 

 \textsc{Lemma.} Let $i\leq c$ and suppose that $w \in A^i$. Assume that $x_{s_i},x_{s_i+1}\ldots,x_{r_i}$ are the standard products with weight $i$ and for $s_i\leq j\leq r_i$ set $y_j=1+x_j$. Then for all $\alpha_{s_i},\ldots,\alpha_{r_i}\in\{0,\ldots,p-1\}$ we have that 
\[ w\equiv \alpha_{s_i}x_{s_i}+\cdots+\alpha_{r_i}x_{r_i}\quad \bmod \quad
A^{i+1} \]
 if an only if 
\[ 1+w\equiv (y_{s_i})^{\alpha_{s_i}}\cdots (y_{r_i})^{\alpha_{r_i}}\quad \bmod
\quad 1+A^{i+1}. \]
 

 Suppose that $w$ is an element of the augmentation ideal $A$ and $1+w$ is a normalised unit. Let $x_1,\ldots,x_{r_1}$ be the standard products of weight 1, and let $y_1,\ldots,y_{r_1}$ be the corresponding elements in the polycyclic generating set. Then using the
previous lemma, we find $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{r_1}$ such that 
\[ w\equiv \alpha_{1}x_{1}+\cdots+\alpha_{r_1}x_{r_1}\quad \bmod \quad A^{2}, \]
 and so 
\[ 1+w\equiv (y_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}\cdots (y_{r_1})^{\alpha_{r_1}}\quad \bmod \quad
1+A^{2}. \]
 Now we have that $1+w=(y_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}\cdots (y_{r_1})^{\alpha_{r_1}}(1+w_2)$ for some $w_2 \in A^2$. Then suppose that $x_{s_2},x_{s_2+1},\ldots,x_{r_2}$ are the standard products of weight 2. We find $\alpha_{s_2},\ldots,\alpha_{r_2}$ such that 
\[ w_2\equiv \alpha_{s_2}x_{s_2}+\cdots+\alpha_{r_2}x_{r_2}\quad \bmod \quad
A^{3}. \]
 Then the lemma above implies that 
\[ 1+w_2\equiv (y_{s_2})^{\alpha_{s_2}}\cdots (y_{r_2})^{\alpha_{r_2}}\quad \bmod
\quad 1+A^{3}. \]
 Thus $1+w_2=(y_{s_2})^{\alpha_{s_2}}\cdots (y_{r_2})^{\alpha_{r_2}}(1+w_3)$ for some $w_3 \in A^3$, and so $1+w=(y_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}\cdots
(y_{r_1})^{\alpha_{r_1}}(y_{s_2})^{\alpha_{s_2}}\cdots
(y_{r_2})^{\alpha_{r_2}}(1+w_3)$. We repeat this process, and after $c$ steps we obtain the canonical form for the element $1+w$. }

  
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Computing a power commutator presentation for $V$}}\label{TheoryFifth}
\logpage{[ 3, 5, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X78FD250584304FB1}{}
{
  Using the procedure in the previous section, it is easy to compute a power
commutator presentation for the normalized unit group $V$ of a $p$-modular group algebra over the field of $p$ elements. First we compute the polycyclic generating sequence $y_1,\ldots,y_{|G|-1}$ as in Section \ref{TheoryThird}. Then for each $y_i$ and for each $y_j,\ y_i$ such that $i<j$ we compute the canonical form for $y_i^p$ and $[y_j,y_i]$ as described in Section \ref{TheoryFourth}. 

 Once a power-commutator presentation for $V$ is constructed, it is easy to obtain a polycyclic presentation for the unit
group $U$ by adding an extra central generator $y$ corresponding to a generator of the cyclic group $F^*$ and enforcing that $y^{p-1}=1$. }

  
\section{\textcolor{Chapter }{Verifying Lie properties of $FG$}}\label{TheorySixth}
\logpage{[ 3, 6, 0 ]}
\hyperdef{L}{X7FAB1A7F87AAE7F0}{}
{
  If $FG$ is a group algebra then one can consider the Lie bracket operation defined by $[a,b]=ab-ba$. Then it is well-known that $FG$ with respect to the scalar multiplication, the addition, and the bracket
operation becomes a Lie algebra over $F$. This Lie algebra is also denoted $FG$. Some Lie properties of such Lie algebras can be computed very efficiently.
In particular, it can be verified whether the Lie algebra $FG$ is nilpotent, soluble, metabelian, centre-by-metabelian. Fast algorithms that
achieve these goals are described in \cite{LR86}, \cite{PPS73}, and \cite{Ros00}. }

 Let $KG$ be a group ring, $f$ be a homomorphism from the group $G$ to the unit group of the ring $K$.

Then the involution of $KG$ induced by $f$ and $s$ is defined by $ \alpha_1 \cdot g_1 + \alpha_2 \cdot g_2 + \cdots + \alpha_k \cdot g_k \mapsto
\alpha_1 \cdot f(g_1) \cdot s(g_1) + \alpha_2 \cdot f(g_2) \cdot s(g_2) +

The two-argument version accepts the image of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape g}} in the group ring $ZG$ obtained using the mapping \texttt{Embedding( G, KG )}. 

 Remark that when $G$ is a finite nilpotent group, the group generated by the Bass cyclic units
contain a subgroup of finite index in the centre of the unit group of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape ZG}} \cite{JePaSe96}. }

 Please note that for calculation of the augmentation of an element of a group
ring the user is strongly recommended to use \texttt{Augmentation} (\ref{Augmentation}) which works much faster than \texttt{AugmentationHomomorphism}. }

\textbf{\indent Returns:\ }
 a record of two components: weighted basis elements and their weights 



 The argument \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape KG}} must be a $p$-modular group algebra. 

 For a group algebra $KG$, let $A$ denote the augmentation ideal, and assume that $c$ is the smallest number such that $A^c=0$. Then a weighted basis of $KG$ is some basis $ b_1, \ldots, b_n $ for the augmentation ideal $A$, for which there are indices $ i_1=1, \ldots, i_{c-1} $ such that $ b_{i_k}, \ldots, b_n $ is a basis for $A^k$. The weight of an element $b_i$ of a weighted basis is the unique integer $w$ such that $b_i$ belongs to $w$-th power of $A$ but does not belong to its $(w+1)$-th power. 

 Note that this function actually constructs a basis for the \emph{augmentation ideal} of \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape KG}} and not for \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape KG}} itself. Since the augmentation ideal has co-dimension 1 in \texttt{KG}, a basis for \texttt{KG} can be easily obtained by adjoining the identity element of the group. 

 The method returns a record whose basis entry is the basis and the weights
entry is a list of the corresponding weights the of basis elements. See
Section \ref{TheoryThird} for more details. }

 The normalised unit group of a $p$-modular group algebra $KG$ over the field of $p$ elements can be computed using two methods, namely \texttt{NormalizedUnitGroup} (\ref{NormalizedUnitGroup}) and \texttt{PcNormalizedUnitGroup} (\ref{PcNormalizedUnitGroup}).

different types of computations. The elements of \texttt{NormalizedUnitGroup(KG)} are represented in their natural group algebra representation, and hence they
can easily be identified in the group algebra. However, the more quickly
constructed \texttt{NormalizedUnitGroup(KG)} is often not suitable for further fast calculations. Hence one will have to
use \texttt{PcNormalizedUnitGroup(KG)} if one wants to find some group theoretic properties of the normalized unit
group. This method returns the bijection from \texttt{NormalizedUnitGroup(\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape KG}})} onto \texttt{PcNormalizedUnitGroup(\mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape KG}})}.

 This method takes a group algebra as its argument, and constructs its
associated Lie algebra in which the product is the bracket operation: $[a,b]=ab-ba$. It is recommended that the user never calls this method. The Lie algebra for
an associative algebra should normally be created using \texttt{LieAlgebra( A )}. When \texttt{LieAlgebra} is first invoked, it constructs the Lie algebra for \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape A}} using \texttt{LieAlgebraByDomain}. After that it stores this Lie algebra and simply returns it if \texttt{LieAlgebra} is called again. }

It can be calculated very fast using Lie dimension subgroups \cite{Shalev91}, that is, using only information about the underlying group; see \texttt{LieDimensionSubgroups} (\ref{LieDimensionSubgroups}).

 \index{lower Lie power series} In a modular group algebra $KG$ the \emph{lower Lie power series} is defined as follows: $KG^{[n]}$ is the associative ideal, generated by all (left-normed) Lie-products $[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $ x_i \in KG $. The lower Lie nilpotency index $t_L(G)$ of the group algebra $KG$ is defined to be the minimal smallest $n$ such that $KG^{[n]}=0$. In \cite{Du} the Jennings' conjecture was proved, which means that the nilpotency class of
the normalized unit group of the modular group algebra $KG$ is equal to $t_L(G)-1$. 

 This allows to express lower Lie nilpotency index via the nilpotency class of
the normalized unit group, and with its polycyclic presentation, provided by \textsf{LAGUNA}, this will be faster than elementary calculations with Lie commutators. As
the previous attribute, this index is also stored as an attribute of the group
algebra \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape KG}}. }

The $m$-th Lie dimension subgroup $ D_{(m)} $ is the intersection of the group $G$ and $ 1+KG^{(m)} $, where $KG^{(m)}$ is the $m$-th term of the upper Lie power series of $KG$; see \texttt{LieUpperNilpotencyIndex} (\ref{LieUpperNilpotencyIndex}) }

 list of subgroups 



 A notion of upper Lie codimension subgroups was introduced in \cite{CS}. For a finite $p$-group \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}}, $C_i$ is the set of all elements $g$ in \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}}, such that the Lie commutator $[ g, g_1, ..., g_i ]$ of the length $i+1$ is equal to zero for all $g_1, ..., g_i$ from \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}}, and $ C_0 = {1} $. By Du's theorem (see \cite{Du}), $C_i$ coincides with the intersection of $G$ and the i-th term of the upper central series ${1}=Z_0 < Z_1 < Z_2 < ... < Z_n = V(KG)$ of the normalized unit group $V(KG)$. This fact is used in \textsf{LAGUNA} to speed up computation of this series. Since $V(KG)$ is involved in computation, for the first time the argiment should be the
group ring \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape KG}}, but later you can also apply it to the group \mbox{\texttt{\mdseries\slshape G}} itself. }

 \texttt{LAGInfo} is a special Info class for \textsf{LAGUNA} algorithms. It has 5 levels: 0, 1 (default), 2, 3 and 4. To change info level
to \texttt{k}, use command \texttt{SetInfoLevel(LAGInfo, k)}. }
